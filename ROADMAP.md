# Roadmap

Our goal is to power a billion devices with the 01's software over the next 10 years.

We can do that with your help. Help extend the 01 to run on new hardware, to connect with new peripherals like GPS and cameras, and to add new locally running language models to unlock use-cases for this technology that no-one has imagined.

In the coming months, we're going to release:

- [ ] A react-native app for your phone
- [ ] Speech-to-speech model support (like `gpt-4o`) instead of TTS/STT
    - [ ] Implement `Ultravox`
- [ ] An open-source language model for computer control
- [ ] A hand-held device that runs fully offline.
