The **01** is an open-source platform for conversational devices, inspired by the *Star Trek* computer.

With [Open Interpreter](https://github.com/OpenInterpreter/open-interpreter) at its core, the **01** is more natural, flexible, and capable than its predecessors. Assistants built on **01** can:

- Execute code
- Browse the web
- Read and create files
- Control third-party software
- ...

<br>

We intend to become the GNU/Linux of this space by staying open, modular, and free.

_Disclaimer:_ The current version of the 01 is a developer preview.
